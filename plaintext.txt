jessica took a deep breath letting the warm smell of horses fill her
nose as she walked into the stable every summer jessica spent two
weeks at green meadow farms horseback riding camp rose her
camp counselor led jessica through the aisle of snorting horses
with jessica looking out for piper her favorite horse last year
jessica and piper had spent days riding the trails at the end of
camp rodeo they finished second in the obstacle course race jessica
loved everything about piper from her speckled gray hair to the
way pipers soft nose tickled her hand whenever jessica fed her
apples
i cant wait to ride piper jessica told rose
rose smiled i know you love piper but we need to save her for
some of our newer riders this year
jessica tried not to let the disappointment show on her face but she
felt crushed piper was one of the best behaved horses so it made
sense that she would be used by the younger
riders still jessica would miss her favorite
horse
nostrils fidgeted apprehension
how about you try riding harley rose said
jessica was a little startled by the giant male horse
in a nearby stall that rose pointed to
even though harley was beautiful with
his shiny chestnut hair and his thick
black mane he looked restless he had
flared nostrils and wild eyes and he
was taller than the other horses
rose could sense jessicas apprehension dont worry he just
needs an ezperienced rider to help train him
jessica tried to stay optimistic hoping that harley would turn out to
be easier to ride than he looked she cautiously approached him
but the horse moved away from her he was just so big thought
jessica as jessica put harleys saddle on his back the horse
fidgeted and brayed making jessica even more nervous and
causing her to fumble with the buckles
jessica glanced at a group of new riders gathering around pipers
stall they patted her neck and in return piper nuxxled her pink nose
on their heads jessica tried not to feel jealous as she adjusted the
saddle on harleys back
an annoyed jessica led a reluctant harley outside she climbed on
top of him and headed to the obstacle course however when they
reached the log fence harley planted his hooves in the dirt refusing
to take another step
